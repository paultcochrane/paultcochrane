# Hi there!

Hi! I’m Paul Cochrane, an experienced multi-purpose software developer.

Most recently, I’ve been involved in data processing and backend system
development using Python and Django, however, I’m also experienced in Perl,
Linux, bash, vim, LaTeX, and git, and I'm not shy when it comes to learning
new systems and technologies.  In fact, since I'm a generalist, you can
throw any problem at me and I'll work out how to solve it in whatever
language or tools as necessary.

I have a PhD in Physics and have worked on software projects in many
different areas, including Physics, Combustion Technology, Scientific
Visualisation, Geospatial Data Delivery, Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) and Game Development.

I’m based in Germany but am originally from New Zealand; I’m fluent in both
English and German.

I’m available for freelance contractor work. Contact me via email at <a
href="mailto:paul@peateasea.de">paul@peateasea.de</a> and let’s discuss how
I can help you solve your business’ hairiest problems.
